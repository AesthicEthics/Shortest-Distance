# Shortest-Distance

This project picks on concepts from Linear Algebra to help simulate the direction vector from the players current position to a set point on the surface of a sphere! In general, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line between them, but in case of a sphere such a straight line would pass through its center. This got me thinking. 

Since earth is a sphere, how can we figure out the direction vector from our location on the earth to some other point on the surface of the earth. Or in other words, what is the spherical equivalent of a straight line between two points(on its surface of course).
